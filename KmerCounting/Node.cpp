    //NOTE: I opted against using reverse Occ to do this computation. I think this may increase the computational time a little, but halves the space requirement, and lowers the complexity of the code.
    
    //This code iterates through the reverse BWT at the interval specified by the reverseInterval and determines how many of the 4 characters are present.
            //After a lot of thought, I think that the code will run at most 5 times per interval (the only children are A,C,T,G and $). It may be valuable to pre-determine the location of the '$' in the reverseBWT-- doing so may save me up to 20% time running this code, although I think my math is wrong and it will not save me that much time at all.
